# OS-Disk-Scheduling-Advanced
he OS Disk Scheduling (Advanced) repository is dedicated to exploring and implementing advanced disk scheduling algorithms used in modern operating systems. This repository provides a hands-on approach to understanding how operating systems manage I/O requests, particularly disk accesses, to optimize system performance, resource utilization, and user experience.

Key Features:
Implementation of Advanced Disk Scheduling Algorithms: This repository includes implementations of several advanced disk scheduling algorithms that go beyond the traditional ones. Algorithms such as LOOK, C-SCAN, C-LOOK, and N-Step LOOK are thoroughly implemented, offering a deeper understanding of how operating systems handle disk I/O.

Performance Evaluation: Each algorithm is accompanied by performance evaluation metrics. We compare these advanced algorithms against traditional methods like FCFS (First Come, First Serve) and SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First), evaluating factors such as seek time, latency, throughput, and fairness.

Detailed Documentation: The repository includes detailed documentation that explains the underlying theory behind each algorithm. You'll find both high-level overviews and in-depth discussions about disk scheduling mechanics, how each algorithm works, and when it should be applied for best results.

Simulations & Real-World Applications: Through simulations, users can visualize the differences in how each disk scheduling algorithm handles a queue of I/O requests. We explore real-world use cases, such as servers with multiple disk drives or systems with heavy read/write operations.
